# selenium-scripts

because Selenium scripts are so easy to write, I didnt want to create a test program like so many others made.
I really tried to go outside of the box and the more complicated scripts that I made did not work very well.
With the larger scripts there was much more complication, my original plan was to create a reddit script that created
multiple new accounts and voted any post positive. This could be used to force things to become viral on reddit.com
The scripts that came out the best were the more simple ones.

Instacreeper
This script only works once in a while, I believe instagram has some sort of protection against these sort of scripts. 
When instagram notices multiple likes in a short amount of time it will revert them. This script was for people to "fake" intstragram
likes in order to make posts more appealing to real users. If you notice a person has 5,000 likes you are more inclined to like their picture 
than if they have 6.

Youtube Downloader
this script combines with a specific firefox add on and will take video and mp3 and store them in your selected folder.
This was the most useful script I came up with and it also gave me important information - that selenium can use firefox add ons.

this is the firefox addon
